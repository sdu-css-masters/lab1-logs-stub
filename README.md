# lab1-logs-stub
As a starting point of your first lab you have one log file of our portal in the period of registration.
Your task is to find a link that was accessed most frequently.

Your task is to create a python script ( or any other ) that reads the log file and generates one text file 'result-link.txt' which will contain one line with most frequently accessed link.

Wish you best!
